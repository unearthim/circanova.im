            <h2>Kazakhstan Erupts in Nationwide Uprising</h2>
            <p>The month began with Kazakhstan facing its worst civil unrest since independence as nationwide protests over fuel prices escalated into a political revolt. A state of emergency was declared as protesters set fire to the presidential residence and seized Almaty International Airport. The crisis led to the government's resignation and an unprecedented request for military assistance from the Russian-led CSTO alliance to suppress what the president called "terrorist gangs."</p>

            <h2>Russia-Ukraine Tensions Reach Breaking Point</h2>
            <p>Following a month of hostile diplomacy, U.S. President Biden warned that Russia might invade Ukraine in February. Russia had amassed significant forces on the Ukrainian border while denying invasion plans, with the core dispute centering on Ukraine's potential NATO membership. The UN Security Council held its first meeting, emphasizing that there was "no alternative to diplomacy."</p>

            <h2>COVID-19 Omicron Variant Spreads Globally</h2>
            <p>The highly transmissible Omicron variant continued its rapid global spread. Health regulators in Mexico granted emergency authorization for Merck's anti-COVID drug, Molnupiravir, while Nigeria announced it was developing its own vaccine.</p>

            <h2>Political Upheavals Across Africa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethiopia</strong> preemptively ended its state of emergency, which had been declared when armed insurgents threatened the capital, Addis Ababa.</li>
                <li>Military forces in <strong>Burkina Faso</strong> staged a coup against the national government, a move that was condemned internationally but proved popular domestically with citizens frustrated by security failures.</li>
                <li>Pro-democracy protests continued in <strong>Sudan</strong> against the military government, with over 70 people killed by security forces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>North Korea Resumes Missile Testing</h2>
            <p>North Korea launched a new series of missile tests over the Sea of Japan. The tests were designed to circumvent American and Japanese missile defense technologies and were seen as a move to preempt new diplomatic engagement with the U.S.</p>
            
            <h2>James Webb Space Telescope Makes History</h2>
            <p>In a positive scientific development, the James Webb Space Telescope successfully entered its orbit, beginning what would become a revolutionary year for astronomy and our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
